-Allows up to 6 event parameters
-Support for every serializable Unity type
-Type-safe, using C# generics
-Automatic event subscriptions
-Expandable and re-orderable inspector drawers
-Optimized for cross-platform with up to 1000% faster invocations speeds over UnityEvents
-Custom, specialized event pattern that offers memory-leak protection over UnityEvents
-Source code included and fully-documented
